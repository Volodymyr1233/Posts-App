This is my Posts App build on React using TypeScript, React Router and React Transition Group

🧑‍💻Functionality:


    ✅ Log in form with simple logic without backend part: if the user is not authorized he doesn't have access to posts. 
    If the user is authorized he has access to posts and can return to log in form with log out button
    ✅ My app connects with API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com and get all necessary posts.
    ✅ Search bar helps search posts by title
    ✅ User can sort posts by title or by description
    ✅ User can choose limit of posts per one load
    ✅ User can create his own post
    ✅ Animation of posts loading and removing
    ✅ User can open post in a separate page where he can see post title and comments from other users.

Hope you enjoy my project🙌
